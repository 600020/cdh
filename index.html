                    <li>My name is Theo Laubsher:</li>
                    <li>Iâ€™m 24 years old</li>

                    <li>Followed by my Advanced Project Management course</li>
                    <li>My whole life the concept of hard work was a reality, and because of this reality I started my work career the same time i had to learn the ABC, 123, and school</li>
                    <li>Thanks to this type of mindset thought to me from a young age I have experienced many different parts of the worlds industry types and formed a well understanding of what is out there and what the world has to offer and the fact that no matter what or who you are the sky is not the limit when it comes to knowledge.</li>
                    <li>In the same breath this lead to a rather weird but broad exposure to what formed me today and what drives me</li>
                    <li>I worked in agriculture from the day I started to walk until my last day in high school</li>
                    <li>After High school my world changed from agriculture to the industrial sector</li>
                    <li>After that my career formed around sales, projects, system integrations and quality standards.</li>
                    <li>to be continued..</li>
